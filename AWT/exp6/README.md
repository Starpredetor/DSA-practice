5.	Theory:

ReactJS –
ReactJS, also known as React or React.js, is an open-source JavaScript library for frontend development. ReactJS is used to create an interactive user interface and it is popular among the developer community. Because of its simplicity, native approach, data binding, performance and testability, ReactJS is often chosen over its other competitive frameworks.

React Virtual DOM – 
The most important part of web application development is DOM manipulation. Unfortunately, this process slow and time consuming in most JavaScript operations. The main reason for it is that the JavaScript frameworks try to update the DOM more than needed. For example, if the list of ten items is created and only one of them is updated, then the most JavaScript framework will rebuild the entire list. However, to solve this problem, React Virtual DOM was introduced. In ReactJS the Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of a real DOM. Manipulating browser DOM objects is much slower than the React virtual DOM because nothing becomes drawn onscreen in the virtual DOM


React Components –
Components are very important in React. Components are small reusable User Interface elements, that provide data for the view. ReactJS enables one to create smaller components and combine them, nest them inside one another to form an entire User Interface. Components take input, also known as props and return react elements and these elements describe the User Interface contents. React components can also be written as a “function component”. They are similar to JavaScript functions.
