3. Theory:
Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. Express.js simplifies the creation of server-side applications and allows developers to create routes to handle different HTTP requests.
In this experiment, we will design a simple HTML form that takes user input, submits it to the server, and processes the form data using Express.js. The form submission will be handled using the POST method, which sends data to the server for further processing. We will use body-parser middleware to parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before handlers.


5. Result:
•	A simple form was created using HTML and served via an Express.js server.
•	The form data was successfully submitted using the POST method and processed on the server.
•	The submitted data (name and email) was displayed on the webpage as a response.

6. Conclusion:
In this experiment, we demonstrated how to set up a Node.js server using Express.js to create a form and handle form submissions. The form data was parsed and processed using the POST method, showcasing how Express.js can handle HTTP requests in a web application. This experiment highlights the ease and flexibility of using Express.js for backend development.
